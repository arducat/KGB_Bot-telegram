# KGB_Bot-telegram
KGB Bot for telegram  
<br />
There is an “anti-swearing” function here.
<br />
Place the files  users.txt and swearing.txt in the directory next to the bot.  
The users.txt file will contain the IDs of those users that need to be monitored.  
The file swearing.txt will contain curse words with which the words of users will be compared to find curse words in them.  
The exceptions.txt file contains the exception words.  
<br />
Once an obscenity is found, the user's message will be deleted.  
<br />
There is also a function called quotes, 
Which takes a random quote from the quotes.txt file and sends it to the user.  
<bt />  
The uptime command shows the bot's operating time.
