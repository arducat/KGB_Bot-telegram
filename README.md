# KGB_Bot-telegram
KGB Bot for telegram  
<br />
So far, it only implements the “anti-swearing” function.  
<br />
Place the files  users.txt and swearing.txt in the directory next to the bot.  
The users.txt file will contain the IDs of those users that need to be monitored.  
The file swearing.txt will contain curse words with which the words of users will be compared to find curse words in them.  
<br />
Once an obscenity is found, the user's message will be deleted.
